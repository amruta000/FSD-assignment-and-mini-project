    <h>Department Profile</h>
    <p>
        Established in 1989, the Department of Computer Science has a rich history of taking the lead in Teaching,
        Research & Development in frontier areas of Computer Science and allied domains. Given the rapid rate of
        obsolescence of knowledge, especially in Computational Sciences, the department faculty strives their best to
        keep abreast with the technology. The same has genuinely helped the department to achieve many laurels and
        emerge on the country's national map of Centres of Excellence. Recently Ministry of Human Resource Development
        (MHRD), Government of India, has recognized the department as a Centre of Excellence in Cyber security and Data
        Science under the scheme Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya National Mission for Teachers
        and Teaching (PMMMNMTT) with grants in aid over Rs. 6 Cr.
