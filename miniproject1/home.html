    <h3>About University</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Shivaji University</b>, established in 1962, is named after the Great Maratha Warrior and founder of the
        Maratha
        empire Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. It was inaugurated on 18th November, 1962 by Dr. Radhakrishnan, the then
        President of India. One of the major objectives behind foundation of this University was to cater to the
        regional needs of South Maharashtra. The jurisdiction of the University is spread over three districts viz.
        Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara with strength of about 3,00,000 students studying in 280 affiliated colleges and
        recognised institutes. This region of Maharashtra boasts of rich and varied socio-cultural heritage. Under the
        innovative and socially reformist leadership of Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, the princely ruler of Kolhapur, the
        city had become at the beginning of this century, a focal point of educational opportunities for all classes and
        communities of South-Western Maharashtra, and northern parts of neighbouring Karnataka. This is also land of
        Karmaveer Bhaurao Patil, who struggled for taking education to the masses by his innovative 'Earn and Learn'
        scheme. When the University was founded by the Shivaji University Act of 1962, the objectives set before the
        University included making opportunities of higher education accessible to rural youth, conducting fundamental
        and applied research in the field of science and humanities to ensure regional growth and development. Shivaji

        In 1962 the University started functioning with 34 affiliated colleges and about 14000 students with 5
        Post-graduate Departments on the campus. Today the number of affiliated colleges has gone upto 280 and students
        strength upto 3,00,000 with 34 Postgraduate Departments on campus. The University imparts education in 10 major
        faculties of Arts, Social Science, Science, Commerce, Education, Fine Arts, Law, Medicine, Ayurvedic Medicine,
        Engineering and Technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        During initial two decades the efforts were concentrated on expansion of higher education and foundation of new
        colleges in different parts in the three districts under its jurisdiction. The University consolidated its base
        in this phase by 'taking education to the people'. The decade of 1980s saw a major expansion, especially the
        growth of professional faculties like Engineering, Education, Management and Medicine. The recent phase of the
        University can be termed as "a pursuit of academic excellence". Since last 4-5 years, several attempts are being
        made to overcome the image of University as a regional University. Several steps have been taken to raise the
        standards of teaching and research so as to measure upto global standards. This is being achieved by exploring
        new areas of higher learning and research in rapidly emerging fields like Industrial Chemistry, Space Science,
        Environmental Science, Bio-Chemistry, Sericulture, Polymer Chemistry and Computer Science, in addition to basic
        science disciplines. The University Department of Physics has been recently identified by UGC for its Special
        Assistance Programme and recognised as Department of Research Support. New research areas in these departments
        are Super conductors Energy, Bio-diversity and Bio-technology. The University has also established the
        University-Industry Interaction Cells in three districts. Shivaji University
